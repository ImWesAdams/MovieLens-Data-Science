This is a brief (one Sunday) project using a dataset of people's movie ratings. It takes the prior movies rated by people (not the ratings, genres, or other information - just the list of movies in order) and predicts the next movie they rate. Performance gains are approximately 10x more accurate using this transformer-encoder structure over simply predicting the most popular movie from the dataset. Transformer-based content prediction/recommendations sytems offer a customizable and effort-saving method of managing and distributing content to users with minimal human effort.

This uses the [MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) {F. Maxwell Harper and Joseph A. Konstan. 2015. The MovieLens Datasets: History and Context. ACM Transactions on Interactive Intelligent Systems (TiiS) 5, 4: 19:1â€“19:19. https://doi.org/10.1145/2827872}.
